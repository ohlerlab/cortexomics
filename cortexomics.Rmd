##Intro
- Importance of understanding gene regulation
- Importance of understanding gene regulation at multiple levels
- Specific importance to the brain
	- complexity of translational regulation in the brain
	- importance of complexes
- Distinction between intra and inter gene variation, discussion of it's importance
- Lack of studies in living tissue that examine Gene expression at multiple levels
-

Clustering


### Figure 1 - Data Quality, 
```{r pdf2 nap, out.width ='900px', out.height ='900px' ,fig.cap = "caption", dev='pdf'}
include_graphics("plots/tmp.pdf")
```
Rnaseq, Riboseq, Mass spec correlations, outlier robust correlations.
- Number, size, mapped reads, correlation between replicates
- Enzymes used, for RIboseq, rationale
- Likely effects this has on the data - e.g. cyclohexamine (see sup figure for sequence preference)


### Figure 2 Riboseq
```{r pdf2 nap, out.width ='900px', out.height ='900px' ,fig.cap = "caption", dev='pdf'}
include_graphics("plots/tmp.pdf")

```
Basic discussion of Riboseq
- Periodicity in our Riboseq
- Number of ORFs recovered
- New ORFS recoovered - e.g. 
- Translational Regulation Tests - Ribodiff


### Figure 3 Mass Spec Integration
```{r pdf2 nap, out.width ='900px', out.height ='900px' ,fig.cap = "caption", dev='pdf'}
include_graphics("plots/tmp.pdf")

```
 - Observation that many genes don't have perceptible reaction to changing riboseq levels
 - calculation of degredation rates?
 -  

### Figure 4 - clustering/sequence analysis
```{r pdf2 nap, out.width ='900px', out.height ='900px' ,fig.cap = "caption", dev='pdf'}
include_graphics("plots/tmp.pdf")```

- possible clustering methods
	- timeless
	- 

- Sequence analysis

##Discussion
Resource for study of cortical development
For comparison to single cell data

'We leveraged replicate measurements to assess data quality and its dependence on several parameters, including alignment strategy, mRNA enrichment method, PCR artifacts, gene length normalization, and batch effects (Supplemental Fig. S2Aâ€“E; Supplemental Methods).''

Methods should be useful, note they measure enrichment of reads in coding sequences.
