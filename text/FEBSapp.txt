What's on your mind?
	Riboseq
		Why have you done all this riboseq?
			We want to measure translation	
				Why
					Translation controls the ultimate quantity of proteins, next frontier of gene regulation.
				
	which papers to read
	How much time to spend on each section
	Procedure for this paper
		I suggest list of refs, abstracts, summaries, sentences
	How much should be included in the grant?
		That depends on guidelines really.
		Probably a lot of biochem


Translation in Neurons
	Does translation matter for the localization of gene expression?
		Trivially yes - mRNAs can only be localized where they are translated.
	What did we learn from the neurites ohler paper

	Does Dorophilas local trans in dev have any real relevance?
