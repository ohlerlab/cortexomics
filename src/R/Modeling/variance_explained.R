#'This script will explore how much of the variance in our mass spec amounts can be explained using different data and models...

#We exepct that the riboseq will explain the Mass Spec better than the RNAseq.
#We expect that the riboseq if corrected will be still better (or maybe correction necessary to get better explanatory power)
#we expect that maybe some genes exist where RNAseq is better, BUT These genes will be genes with weird, and/or low Riboseq
#We at least expect that for TE genes, the Riboseq will explain the mass spec better.
