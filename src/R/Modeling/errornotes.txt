trying to change the ode integrate function but bugs
	I failed to see one of the old parameters sitting in the function
		=> Use find replace systematically when editing a function
		=> Greater emphasis on reading the code not just reacting


DIdn't consider  what an  issue the log thing really   is.

Didn't consider that i needed to take a definite integral on the function where time was being integrated.

Getting stuck in rseq again - hard to predict, remember when introducing or changing a col will cause downstream problems
	Needed to have a set up with rapid feedback - spent too long watching things rerun instead of building options to work around them.

Didn't consider the complexity of memoization... Particularly with regards to reloading functions.

I need to consider code as a flexible structure, no just a one shot.
What effeects flexibility?

I might use existing code, but change
	Axes
	Transform axes
	Changing thresholds
