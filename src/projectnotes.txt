###REMEMBER - 
- When in doubt organize, overview, look at the paper plan, read, until you realize the urgency and import
- Plenty of papers in the papers folder




Where am I?
Endgame
- determine, as quickly as possible, whether the kinetic model is worth anything (by looking at only those genes who have in any way determined deg/synth).




Possible things to do 
- Use positive control for the sequence adjustments
	So the 28 bp guys are are fucked up
- define weird ones
- 
- pick out guys with significant MS effect to model kinetically.
		make sure that increasing things pin down synthesis and degredation.
	 	After this i can do my fuzzy clustering and see if it makes a different

- you are going to limma with precision weights from the Mass spec, and you are going to
