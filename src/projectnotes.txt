okay time to get out of the fog.

Mappability calculations are time consuming as I"ve learned.
So should be done right first time.

Maybe should limit to transcriptome?

But then we have to remap, to the transcriptome.

which means we have to think about mappability when we do our read counts.

Which means we should test the impact of our various counting methods

Which means for fuck sake I need to look at these.


- Think about list of things that can go wron gin RNAseq
- Get final expr levels down and put them in 

Do I want to do this by chromosome maybe?

Okay so
My bw such as it is is odd - consecture regions aren't getting collapsed, and the nn regions are missing.
Actually maybe stuff not mapping is okay?

indexing is something I"ll need to be sure of. Are Bams 0 indexed???

mappability pythons cript is giong slow
