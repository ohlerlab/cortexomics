###REMEMBER - 
- When in doubt organize, overview, look at the paper plan, read, until you realize the urgency and import
- Plenty of papers in the papers folder



So where am I?
Okay I think I  have a simple, sensible answer - take the easy route, use piecewise linear functions.

Okay so piecewise thing now works beautifully in R. Can translate direclty to 

Splines  face the problem where determing backwards is constrainedi n a really awkwards way

I'm pretty sure that I can just use splines to get around the ODE and model this very quickly. Actually reading Liu et al helped. Now I need to actually read INSIGHT.
THen I need to solve the meta problem of me not actually reading

I think I can maybe use offset to fix the effects for the spline and dspline 

okay so we got to somewhere with Philip and I think I can fit that relatively okay equation now, should probably just do so in stan....	

Outlier robustness?
	Fitting a t distribution



Where am I?
Endgame
- determine, as quickly as possible, whether the kinetic model is worth anything (by looking at only those genes who have in any way determined deg/synth).

 so - adding uncertainty in the mRNA DRAMATICALLY increases the issues with 


Possible things to do 
- Use positive control for the sequence adjustments
	So the 28 bp guys are are fucked up
- define weird ones
- 
- pick out guys with significant MS effect to model kinetically.
		make sure that increasing things pin down synthesis and degredation.
	 	After this i can do my fuzzy clustering and see if it makes a different

- you are going to limma with precision weights from the Mass spec, and you are going to
