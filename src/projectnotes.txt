###REMEMBER - 
TAPs, meds, speed.

####Presently:
Making sure lib norm for the genes is ok not double counting ORFs.
Then including the models in our trajectory plots on shiny.
	#Doing this with REAL CODE - modularity. Acceptance that I forget stuff and
		.

Questions 2020-01-06 10:18
Zoya Ignatova - what does she know about norm?
I guess I can at least re-do the psite adjustment to work better
What can I learn from Baum et al 2019

#modeling
see modellingnotes.txt
Okay so curren thinking - I need to read up more on the fuzzy clustering with splines
I need to be comfortable using lagrange multipliers - how do i make it work with multiple constraints - 
	flatnes son the 

2020-01-06 10:37 Worried about the normalization.
	Can I just look at the distribution of the MS effects mebbe?

Possible things to do 
- pick out guys with significant MS effect to model kinetically.
		make sure that increasing things pin down synthesis and degredation.
	 	After this i can do my fuzzy clustering and see if it makes a difference....

#Something is borking R environment - R2 seems okay for now
```installed.packages()%>%saveRDS('./envs/installed_rpackages.rds')```

Fuzzy clustering paper

Tasks for after
Deal with dropout directly.

#This file is currently doing a lot of work - creating the joint and the seperate models with degredation and synthesis.

#IDE setup wishlist
Copy text easily back from terminal 	
linting
local copies of stuff.

Good morning check: Is everything gitted?
