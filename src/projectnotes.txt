Where am I?

Possible things to do 
- Use positive control for the sequence adjustments
	So the 28 bp guys are are fucked up
- define weird ones
- 
- pick out guys with significant MS effect to model kinetically.
		make sure that increasing things pin down synthesis and degredation.
	 	After this i can do my fuzzy clustering and see if it makes a different
