###REMEMBER - 
- When in doubt organize, overview, look at the paper plan, read, until you realize the urgency and import
- Plenty of papers in the papers folder

Questions
Do the peaks over codons vary according to 

For locations with particularly high spikes, do the locations of the 3' and 5' reads appear independent? Or close to it?

Zoya Ignatova - what does she know about norm?

I guess I can at least re-do the psite adjustment to work better

I want this fucking kinetic modeling to work, at least a bit.
Last was with optim. I can stitll jussts stick some reegularization in optim, get better fit, I think...



Okay so curren thinking - I need to read up more on the fuzzy clustering with splines
I need to be comfortable using lagrange multipliers - how do i make it work with multiple constraints - 
	flatnes son the 

see modellingnotes.txt

Is the kinetic model even worth it?

Possible things to do 
- Use positive control for the sequence adjustments
	So the 28 bp guys are are fucked up
- define weird ones
- pick out guys with significant MS effect to model kinetically.
		make sure that increasing things pin down synthesis and degredation.
	 	After this i can do my fuzzy clustering and see if it makes a different

- you are going to limma with precision weights from the Mass spec, and you are going to
