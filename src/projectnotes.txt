Ebp1 paper final toudhes just done. Gave up on sequence spec psite adjustments. Now just gonna do periodicity, checks on the clipping of CDS regions, then try to improve the model a bit more. About to go to 



After this i can do my fuzzy clustering and see if it makes a different

Then also I can look at the coverage of the weird cases

indexing is something I"ll need to be sure of. Are Bams 0 indexed???
