###REMEMBER - 
- When in doubt organize, overview, look at the paper plan, read, until you realize the urgency and import
- Plenty of papers in the papers folder

So where am I?
I want this fucking kinetic modeling to work, at least a bit.
Last was with optim. I can stitll jussts stick some reegularization in optim, get better fit, I think...



Okay so curren thinking - I need to read up more on the fuzzy clustering with splines
I need to be comfortable using lagrange multipliers - how do i make it work with multiple constraints - 
	flatnes son the 

see modellingnotes.txt

Is the kinetic model even worth it?

Possible things to do 
- Use positive control for the sequence adjustments
	So the 28 bp guys are are fucked up
- define weird ones
- pick out guys with significant MS effect to model kinetically.
		make sure that increasing things pin down synthesis and degredation.
	 	After this i can do my fuzzy clustering and see if it makes a different

- you are going to limma with precision weights from the Mass spec, and you are going to
